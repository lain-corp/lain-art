# Face Recognition System Status

## ✅ What's Working

1. **Persistent Face Database**
   - Implemented using ic-stable-structures
   - Survives canister upgrades
   - Currently stores 1 face: "Lain" (from 02.png)

2. **Recognition System**
   - Face detection model loaded (version-RFB-320.onnx)
   - Face recognition model loaded (face-recognition.onnx)
   - Successfully recognizes 02.png as "Lain" with score 0.0

3. **Test Scripts**
   - `test_recognition.ts` - TypeScript test script
   - Works with small images (< 6KB)
   - Command: `npx tsx test_recognition.ts <image_path>`

## ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **Large Image Recognition**
   - Images > 6KB cause Candid deserialization errors
   - Likely due to canister returning error in unexpected format
   - Need to investigate canister response for large images

2. **Limited Training Data**
   - Only 1 reference face in database
   - Need to add 12 more Lain faces for better recognition
   - Use Candid UI to upload: https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.icp0.io/?id=kfp4o-2qaaa-aaaab-qcmsa-cai

## �� Next Steps

1. **Add More Reference Faces**
   - Upload remaining 12 PNG files via Candid UI
   - Use the "add" method with label "Lain"
   - Click "File" button to upload directly

2. **Fix Large Image Handling**
   - Debug why large images cause deserialization errors
   - May need to check canister error handling
   - Consider adding better error responses

3. **Test Recognition Accuracy**
   - Once more faces are added, test all images
   - Check recognition scores across different images
   - Verify threshold (0.85) is appropriate

## 🔧 Commands

```bash
# Check face database
dfx canister call lain_art_backend list_stored_faces --network ic
dfx canister call lain_art_backend get_face_count --network ic

# Test recognition (small images only for now)
npx tsx test_recognition.ts laindb/02.png

# Add face via CLI (only works for very small images < 6KB)
# Better to use Candid UI for larger images
```

## 📊 Current Stats

- **Faces in database:** 1 ("Lain")
- **Models loaded:** ✅ Both (detection + recognition)
- **Canister cycles:** ~1.6T (healthy)
- **Memory usage:** 5.1GB (models in stable storage)
